# üå† Stellar Command Insights (SCI)

**Stellar Command Insights (SCI)** is a real-time monitoring, visualization, and alerting system designed to help Stellar developers, system administrators, and blockchain enthusiasts gain deep insights into **Stellar CLI and RPC command executions**.

Built on the powerful **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**, SCI provides a user-friendly platform to capture, analyze, and visualize command data‚Äîbringing transparency, observability, and operational intelligence to Stellar-based development.

## üß± Architecture Overview

SCI is composed of the following components:

- **CLI & RPC Logger** ‚Äì Captures `soroban` CLI and RPC command executions and logs them to `stellar.log`.
- **Filebeat** ‚Äì Monitors the log file and forwards new entries to Logstash.
- **Logstash** ‚Äì Parses and structures the logs before sending them to Elasticsearch.
- **Elasticsearch** ‚Äì Indexes and stores log data for querying and analysis.
- **Kibana** ‚Äì Provides a visual interface for dashboards, filtering, and reporting.
- **Alerting System** ‚Äì Sends configurable alerts through Telegram or Slack.
